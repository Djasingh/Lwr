Locally Weighted Regression:


Run Assingment1_Eda.py.  (Python version: 3.6.3)

It will print the mean absolute error, mean squared error and root mean square error value in console.

It will also generate file result.csv, which includes all test instances along with their index, feature value, actual value and predicted value.

The hyper-parameter value used for locally weighted regression model:
c=0.2, learning rate=0.1, 25 nearest neighbours are considered for the experiment. 

I have also included the result.csv file.

Other information regarding code is provided with comment.
